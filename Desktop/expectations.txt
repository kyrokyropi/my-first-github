[MY EXPECTATIONS]

I am very excited on taking this course. I really want to learn about web programming because of how much things you can do with it. I expect this subject to be challenging but somewhat a subject that I will enjoy. I know that I will enjoy the lab class because I learned a lot from sir Sam last sem in my CMSC 130. I hope this course will teach me things that I can use for the rest of my life.
